# Health-Economics---Markov-Model
Excel-based Markov model simulating disease progression and evaluating treatment cost-effectiveness. Includes transition probability matrix, state costs and utilities, discounting, and ICER calculation for health economic evaluation.

# Description
This project builds a cohort-based Markov model in Microsoft Excel to demonstrate key concepts in health economic evaluation. The model simulates patient transitions across health states (“Healthy,” “Sick,” “Dead”) over multiple cycles, applying costs, utilities, and discounting to estimate total outcomes and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Designed as a learning exercise inspired by Cost-Effectiveness Modelling in healthcare.
