# Health-Economics projects
Excel-based Markov model simulating disease progression and evaluating treatment cost-effectiveness. Includes transition probability matrix, state costs and utilities, discounting, and ICER calculation for health economic evaluation.

# ü©∫ Markov Model for Health Economic Evaluation (Excel)

This project builds a cohort-based Markov model in Microsoft Excel to simulate disease progression and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a healthcare intervention.
The model applies key concepts from health economics and decision analysis, including transition probabilities, state costs, utilities, discounting, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

This work was inspired by online resources and adapted as a self-directed learning project to strengthen technical and analytical skills relevant to health economic modelling.

## Model Structure

Health States: Healthy ‚Üí Sick ‚Üí Dead

Cycle Length: 1 year

Number of Cycles: 36

Transition Probabilities: Defined via a 3√ó3 probability matrix

Population Updates: Calculated each cycle using Excel‚Äôs MMULT() function

Costs and Utilities: Assigned per health state and accumulated across cycles

Discounting: Applied at 3.5% annually to both costs and health outcomes


## Key Features

‚úÖ Cohort simulation using matrix multiplication (MMULT)

‚úÖ Annual cycle updates and population tracking

‚úÖ Integration of cost, utility, and transition data

‚úÖ Discounting of future outcomes

‚úÖ Calculation of ICERs for comparative evaluation

‚úÖ Visualization of Markov traces over time
